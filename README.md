### The AI-native general-purpose programming language

**A simple, fast, batteries-included language — designed so AI agents write it well, with the LLM built in as a first-class primitive.**

> **Philosophy:** *"The language adapts to the AI, not the AI to the language."*

Fluxon is a general-purpose programming language — like Go or Python, you use it
to write scripts, tools, data-processing, services, and full applications. What
makes it different is **who it was designed for**: AI agents.

Today's languages were built for humans. They let you do one thing a dozen ways,
with syntax that's convenient but token-wasteful. For an AI agent that's noise —
every "decision point" is a chance to slip, every redundant character wastes
context. Fluxon takes the opposite path: **one task = one way**, short but
readable syntax, and the things AI-era programs reach for most — including the
LLM itself — built right into the language.

## A whole web service in one file

Everything you reach for — HTTP, a database, the LLM — is already in the
language. No frameworks, no `npm install`:

```fx
use http db

http.on :get "/hello" \req ->
  rep 200 {msg:"hello, world"}

http.serve 8080
```

That's a running server — no package installs, no connection code, no
boilerplate. And the LLM is just as close: `ai.ask` / `ai.json` / `ai.run` are
keywords, not an SDK, with providers auto-detected from the environment.

## Install

**Linux / macOS** — one line (downloads the latest release, verifies its
checksum, and installs it onto your PATH):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://fluxon-lang.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://fluxon-lang.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then run a file:

```sh
fluxon run hello.fx        # run a .fx file
fluxon repl                # interactive REPL
fluxon --help              # all commands
```

<details>
<summary><b>Other install options</b></summary>

The installer always grabs the latest release. Prefer a manual download? Grab
the archive for your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/fluxon-lang/fluxon/releases).

**From source** (Rust toolchain required):

```sh
cd runtime
cargo run -- run examples/demo.fx
# or install the binary:  cargo install --path runtime
```

## Why Fluxon

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧩 **General-purpose** | A real language — scripts, CLIs, tools, data work, and full services. Functions, closures, pattern matching, errors, parallelism (`par`), pipes (`\|>`). |
| 🎯 **One task = one way** | The only way to iterate is `each`. One way to output. The AI never wonders "which way should I choose?" — there is no choice, so there are fewer mistakes. |
| ⚡ **Few tokens, still readable** | Short syntax, but never cryptic. Keywords are spelled out in full (`each`, `match`, `else`) — an AI seeing Fluxon for the first time understands it immediately. |
| 🔋 **Batteries included** | `http`, `db`, `ai`, `auth`, `crypto`, `ws`, `cron`, `queue`, `reg`, `sh`, `tui`, `json` — all built in. No `npm install`. Only what you use ends up in the binary (tree-shaking). |
| 🤖 **AI as a primitive** | Calling an LLM is a keyword, not an SDK. Structured output, confidence, token count, and cost all come back built in. Providers auto-detect from the environment. |

---

## Status — Beta

The language core and **every battery in the spec** are implemented and covered
by **479 passing tests**. The runtime (Rust, tree-walking interpreter) runs
`.fx` files, serves HTTP/WebSocket, talks to a database, and drives LLM agents
today.

<details>
<summary><b>What works right now</b></summary>

- **Language core:** types, bindings (`=`/`<-`), `fn`/lambda/closure,
  `if`/`each`/`match`, operators, string interpolation, errors (`fail`/`!`/`??`),
  `try`/`catch`, `par` (parallel fan-out), and the `|>` pipe.
- **Core modules:** `str`, `math`, `rand`, `json`, `time`, `env`, `io`, `fs`,
  `sh`, leveled `log`, plus `assert` + a built-in `fluxon test` runner and an
  interactive REPL.
- **Batteries (all of them):** **`http`** (server + client + middleware +
  static), **`db`** (SQLite, transactions, schema, auto-migration, query
  builder), **`ai`** (LLM — `ai.ask`/`ai.json`/`ai.run`, Anthropic + OpenAI
  auto-detect, tool-loop, confidence/token/cost metadata, retry + timeout),
  **`auth`** (JWT + password hashing), **`crypto`**, **`ws`** (websocket),
  **`cron`**, **`queue`**, **`reg`** (tool registry for agents).

The CLI ships `fluxon run`, `fluxon check` (lex + parse), `fluxon test`, and an
interactive `fluxon repl`.

</details>

What's still on the roadmap (Postgres/MySQL backends, semantic/static checking,
`fluxon fmt`, packaging, an LSP) is tracked in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## How the language was designed

Fluxon was built through **stress testing** — with evidence, not guesswork:

1. **Research** — we studied which code patterns AI writes most reliably and
   with the fewest tokens (declarative DSLs, canonical form, batteries).
2. **Invention** — several AI models were each asked to "invent a language for
   AI." Independently, multiple models converged on the same ideas — and that
   convergence showed there is a "correct" design.
3. **Testing** — the spec was handed to AI models that had **never seen** the
   language (opus, sonnet, haiku) and asked to build real projects. Each "spec
   gap" a model hit exposed a real shortcoming.
4. **Refinement** — the gaps were closed, then re-tested. Over several rounds the
   language deepened — from small utilities to large systems.

The whole process is preserved in the [`research/`](research/) folder.
